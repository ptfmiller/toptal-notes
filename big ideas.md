# Very high-funnel activity

There is news coming out regularly about relevant issues. We should see whether we can take advantage of the interest/fear.

**Imagine a toptal blog post shows up as one of the top three results, "5 options for moving off Parse" and has soft selling within the post.** 

# Crowding

There are a lot of people who want to sound exactly the same as us! They have similar search results (apparently everyone has the best developers).

## The big question
How are we differentiated? 

1. Comparison shoppers need to see something different. The top 3% deal, though I thought it was a bit awkwardly specific at first, seems to sell the point to any skeptic who may think "why should I believe you have top talent? Doesn't everyone?"
2. Be first in search results
3. Website could reinforce the idea that this is white glove option. Maybe a website that resembles a luxury car brand or the like
